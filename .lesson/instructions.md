# Logic Practice

This is the first time you have seen practice problems like this. It is a little confusing to explain so an example problem will make things easier. 

## Example
Given a number return the number before it (`this is the explanation of what your code should do`)

example: (10) -> 9 (`Your code will have inputs and outputs. In this case you recieve a 10 and give back or return a 9`)

example: (5) -> 4 (`A second example of what is expected behavior is given in case the first one was unclear. On this one you are given 5 and you return 4`)

You need to think about what your code needs to do to accomplish the above. That is if you were given any possible number lets call it `num` what would you do.

`num` was chosen because if you look at index.js line 1 you can see `(num)`.

The code we need to accomplish this is:

```javascript
return num - 1
```

replace line 2 with the above code.  Now we need to check to see if this code works. Go to the tools section in the bottom left and find the square that is test. This should open a tab on the left called test. Click run tests and go to the console tab. At the bottom of the console tab you should see 1/11 passed with a green check mark.

You need to continue doing all of the problems until you have 11 green checkmarks.

## Problem 1
Given 2 numbers return true if they are equal

example: (2,3) -> false

example: (3,3) -> true

hints: search "js if" and "js operators"
#
## Problem 2
Given a number that is a string check if the number is greater than 16

example: ("2") -> false

example: ("17") -> true

hints: search "js string to number"
#
## Problem 3
Given a number return `less than 10` if it is less than 10, `equal to 10` if it is equal to 10, `greater than 10` if it is greater than 10

example: (3) -> "less than 10"

example: (10) -> "equal to 10"

example: (15) -> "greater than 10"

hints: search "js if else if"
#
## Problem 4
given a word use a switch to return the following

example: ("apple") -> "a"

example: ("bill") -> "b"

example: ("cat") -> "c"

...

example: ("koolaid") -> "k"

example: ("lime") -> "Past the letter k"

example: ("young") -> "Past the letter k"

hint: search "js switch"
#
## Problem 5
given two number return the sum

example: (2,3) -> 5

example: (3,6) -> 9

hints: search "js operators"
#
## Problem 6
Given minutes return seconds

example: (1) -> 60

example: (10) -> 600

hints: "minutes in seconds" and "js operators"
#
## Problem 7
given a number return the next number

example: (4) -> 5

example: (88) -> 89

hints: search "js operators"
#
## Problem 8
given basketball 2's and 3's made return the total score

example: (4, 2) -> 14

example: (1,1) -> 5

hints: search "js operators" and remember your order of operations. You will need parenthesis
#
## Problem 9
given a number return if it is divisible by 5

example: (5) -> true
example: (11) -> false

hints: search "js determine if a number is divisible"
#
## Problem 10
given inches return feet

example: (12) -> 1

example: (24) -> 2

example: (30) -> 2.5

hints: search "inches in a foot" and "js operators"
